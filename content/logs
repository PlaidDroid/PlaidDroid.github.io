Started working on my website. This website is going to hold all the info about my projects and works. Currently hosting in github.io, but maybe, maybe, later on, I'll shift it to another domain. Currently working on integrating Themes & Memex, and planning to take off my blog off blogger.

Sort of finished adding the theme setup(with the 'gotham' theme) and also the memex. Need to furnish the landing page.
